        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-textPrimary mb-6">Why "dumb" beats black-box smart</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-textMuted">Transparent and predictable wins every time.</p>
      </div>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-textPrimary">You know what you're getting</h3>
          <p>Latest is chronological. For You uses only the settings you configure. No hidden engagement optimization. No mysterious "this might interest you" insertions. When we say "dumb," we mean it doesn't try to outsmart you with secret sauce.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-textPrimary">No anxiety, no FOMO</h3>
          <p>With chronological Latest, you scroll once and you're done. No wondering if the algorithm hid something important. No refreshing compulsively because posts appear out of order. You see it all, in order, once.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-textPrimary">Character limits enforce honesty</h3>
          <p>When every post is short, the algorithm can't favor long-form or video over text. No format wars. No "the algorithm prefers carousels this week" nonsense. Just who said it, what it's about, and how active the conversation is.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-textPrimary">Real conversations, not performances</h3>
          <p>Without public like counts, people stop optimizing for virality and start sharing what's actually useful. Threads with 50 replies surface, not posts with 5000 hollow likes. You find substance, not spectacle.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-3">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-textPrimary">Built for readers, not influencers</h3>
          <p>Kural is designed for people who want to stay informed, discover quality discussions, and share concise updates, not build a personal brand. If you're tired of everyone treating social media like a content treadmill, you'll appreciate the difference.</p>
