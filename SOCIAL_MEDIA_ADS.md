## 1. "Just Imagine..." (Visualization)
*Goal: Help users visualize the benefit of total control and truth.*

### Ad 1: The Perfect Feed
**Hook:** Just imagine a social feed that actually listens to you.
**Body:** You type "show me more AI research" or "mute politics"—and it happens instantly. No fighting the algorithm. No rage-bait. Just the content you actually want to see.
**CTA:** Join the Beta → kurral.app

### Ad 2: Truth First
**Hook:** Just imagine scrolling without wondering "is this true?"
**Body:** What if every post you saw was already fact-checked by AI? False claims blocked *before* they reach your eyes. No viral lies. Just verified reality.

## 2. "How Open-Minded Are You...?" (Curiosity/Non-Confrontational)
*Goal: Invite users to try a new paradigm without attacking their current habits.*

### Ad 1: The Algorithm Shift
**Hook:** How open-minded are you about becoming the algorithm?
**Body:** Instead of letting black-box systems decide what you see, what if you just told your feed what you wanted in plain English? It's a different approach to social media—one where you're in charge.
**CTA:** Take Control → kurral.app

### Ad 2: Value Over Views
**Hook:** How open-minded are you about earning from value, not views?
**Body:** Most platforms pay for clicks. We're trying something different: paying for factual rigor, insight, and depth. If you're tired of the clickbait game, this might be for you.

## 3. "What Happens Next..." (Process/Ease)
*Goal: Remove friction and fear of the unknown.*

### Ad 1: The Sign-Up Flow
**Hook:** What happens next is surprisingly simple.
**Body:** You create an account. You type one sentence about what you want to see (e.g., "I love design and tech, but hate politics"). And your feed instantly transforms. No complex settings. No learning curve.
**CTA:** Start Your Journey → kurral.app

### Ad 2: The Fact-Check
**Hook:** What happens next when you post?
**Body:** Before your post goes live, our AI scans it against real-world sources (CDC, Reuters, Nature). Verified facts get a green light. False claims get blocked. You build credibility instantly.
**CTA:** Try It Now → kurral.app

## 4. "Most People..." (Social Proof)
*Goal: Validate the user's frustration and show the new norm.*

### Ad 1: The Feed Frustration
**Hook:** Most people are tired of fighting their feed.
**Body:** We found that users who switch to natural language control never want to go back to standard algorithms. It turns out, simply asking for what you want works better than "optimizing for engagement."
**CTA:** Join the Movement → kurral.app

### Ad 2: The Creator Shift
**Hook:** Most creators know the "viral game" is broken.
**Body:** That's why thousands are looking for a platform that rewards depth and accuracy over rage-bait. Kurral scores every post on 5 dimensions of real value.
**CTA:** Get Your Score → kurral.app

*Goal: Low-risk micro-commitment.*

### Ad 1: The Time Saver
**Hook:** If I could show you a way to fix your feed in 10 seconds, would you try it?
**Body:** No diving into settings menus. No blocking hundreds of accounts. Just type "Show me less crypto, more startups." Done.
**CTA:** Fix Your Feed → kurral.app

### Ad 2: The Trust Factor
**Hook:** If I could guarantee you'd never see a viral lie again, would you switch?
**Body:** Our real-time AI fact-checking blocks false information *before* it spreads. It's the only feed where you can trust what you read by default.
