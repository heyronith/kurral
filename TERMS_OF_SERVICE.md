# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: December 13, 2025**

Welcome to Kural. These Terms of Service ("**Terms**") govern your access to and use of the Kural platform, including our website, mobile applications, and services (collectively, "**Kural**" or the "**Service**"). 

**Note:** Kural is currently operated as a beta service. The Service is provided by the operator(s) of Kural ("**we**", "**us**", "**our**"). These Terms may be updated when Kural is formally incorporated as a legal entity. 

By accessing or using Kural, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.

Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information about your legal rights, remedies, and obligations. These Terms include an agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration (instead of suing in court) and to waive jury trials and class actions in most cases. Please read Section 15 carefully.

---

## 4. Truth Intelligence and Fact-Checking

### 4.1 Automated Fact-Checking
Kural uses Truth Intelligence, an automated system that verifies factual claims in posts using AI analysis and, when necessary, human intervention. Every post is analyzed for verifiable factual claims before it goes live.

### 4.2 Fact-Check Process
When you post content containing factual claims:
- Our system automatically extracts verifiable claims from your content
- Each claim is evaluated against available evidence from multiple sources
- Claims are assigned verdicts: "true", "false", "mixed" (conflicting evidence), or "unknown" (cannot be verified)
- Each verdict includes a confidence score

### 4.3 Content Status
Based on fact-check results, your content may be assigned one of the following statuses:
- **Clean**: All claims verified as true or low-risk
- **Needs Review**: Contains high-risk claims (health, finance, politics) with mixed or unknown evidence, or unverifiable claims
- **Blocked**: Contains false claims verified with high confidence

### 4.4 High-Risk Claims
Claims in sensitive domains (health, finance, politics) are subject to stricter verification standards. High-risk claims with mixed or unknown evidence are automatically flagged for human review.

### 4.5 Visibility of Fact-Check Results
All fact-check results are visible to users with evidence citations. Posts with "needs review" or "blocked" status are displayed with visual indicators (colored borders) to alert users, but may still be visible in feeds depending on the severity.

### 4.6 No Guarantee of Accuracy
While we use our best efforts to verify claims, we do not guarantee that all fact-check results are 100% accurate. Fact-checking is an evolving process, and new evidence may emerge over time. You understand that fact-check results are provided for informational purposes and should not be your sole basis for making important decisions.

## 5. Kural Score System

### 5.1 What is the Kural Score
The Kural Score is a proprietary scoring system (0-100) that measures your content's quality, trustworthiness, and value across five dimensions:
- **Factual Rigor (Epistemic)**: Accuracy and correctness of factual claims
- **Insight**: Novelty, synthesis, and non-obvious perspectives
- **Practical Value**: Actionable guidance and clear takeaways
- **Tone and Discourse Quality**: Healthy discourse, empathy, and constructive communication
- **Effort and Depth**: Depth of work, sourcing, and structure

### 5.2 How Scores are Calculated
Your Kural Score is calculated dynamically using our proprietary algorithm that considers:
- Quality history (40% weight)
- Violation history (25% weight)
- Engagement quality (15% weight)
- Consistency (10% weight)
- Community trust (10% weight)

Scores update in real-time as new posts are published and fact-checked.

### 5.3 Score Impact
Your Kural Score affects:
- Content visibility and reach
- Recognition and credibility on the platform
- Eligibility for monetization (requires minimum score of 77)
- Community trust and reputation

### 5.4 Score Penalties
Sharing false information, violating policies, or engaging in prohibited conduct will result in score penalties. Repeated violations or severe misinformation result in significant score reductions that affect your credibility and reach.

### 5.5 Score Recovery
The system tracks violations over time with decay, allowing users to recover through consistent quality contributions. Your score can improve as you post verified, high-quality content.

### 5.6 No Guarantee of Score
We do not guarantee that your Kural Score will increase, remain stable, or reach any particular threshold. Scores are calculated using our proprietary algorithm and may change based on various factors beyond your direct control.

## 8. Monetization and Value-Based Recognition

### 8.1 Value-Based System
Kural uses a value-based recognition system rather than view-based metrics. Recognition and future monetization are based on the quality and value of your content, as measured by the Kural Score system, not on engagement metrics like views or clicks.

### 8.2 Monetization Eligibility
To be eligible for monetization (when available), you must meet the following criteria:
- **Kural Score**: Minimum score of 77
- **Account Age**: Account must be at least 30 days old

We reserve the right to modify these eligibility requirements at any time.

- Advanced feed controls
- Audience Tuning features
- Monetization eligibility

Beta users retain lifetime access to these features at no cost.

### 8.5 Future Monetization
We plan to introduce monetization based on the value system in the future. When monetization becomes available:
- Payments will be based on your Kural Score and value contributions, not views
- Quality creators will be recognized and compensated for value, not vanity metrics
- Clickbait and rage-bait content will not be rewarded

We will provide additional terms and conditions when monetization features become available.

### 8.6 No Guarantee of Monetization
We do not guarantee that monetization will be available, that you will be eligible, or that you will earn any particular amount. Monetization is subject to our discretion and may be modified or discontinued at any time.
