# 🔧 OpenAI Proxy Setup Fix

## ❌ Current Error

You're seeing this error:
```
POST https://www.mykural.app/api/openai-proxy 500 (Internal Server Error)
[BaseAgent] OpenAI error: Error: Server error: OpenAI proxy is not configured. Please contact support.
```

## ✅ Root Cause

The `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is **not set** in your Vercel deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Copy your API key (starts with `sk-...`)
- If you don't have one, create a new secret key

### Step 2: Add to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (`Dumbfeed` or `mykural`)
3. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add New**
5. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `sk-...` (paste your key)
   - **Environment:** Select all three:
     - ✅ Production
     - ✅ Preview  
     - ✅ Development
6. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **⋯** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 4: Verify
Run this command to check if it's working:
```bash
node scripts/verify-openai-proxy-setup.js https://www.mykural.app
```

Or visit in browser:
```
https://www.mykural.app/api/openai-proxy-health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "configured",
  "message": "OpenAI API key is configured"
}
```

## 🧪 Test the Fix

1. Go to your deployed app: https://www.mykural.app
2. Try onboarding a user (Step 2)
3. Check browser console - should see:
   ```
   [BaseAgent] Calling OpenAI API (via proxy) with model: gpt-4o-mini
   [BaseAgent] OpenAI response received, length: XXX
   ```
4. No more 500 errors! ✅

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing 500 error after setup?
1. **Check Vercel logs:**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions → `openai-proxy` → Logs
   - Look for `[openai-proxy] OPENAI_API_KEY not found`

2. **Verify environment variable:**
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists
   - Make sure it's enabled for **Production** environment

3. **Check deployment:**
   - Make sure you redeployed AFTER adding the env var
   - Environment variables only apply to NEW deployments

4. **Test health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://www.mykural.app/api/openai-proxy-health
   ```

### Error: "Method not allowed" on health check?
- The health endpoint should accept GET requests
- If you see 405, the file might not be deployed yet
- Redeploy and try again

## 📝 What Changed

I've improved the error messages to be more helpful:
- ✅ Better error messages that explain the issue
- ✅ Health check endpoint: `/api/openai-proxy-health`
- ✅ Verification script: `scripts/verify-openai-proxy-setup.js`

## 🎯 Next Steps After Fix

Once the proxy is working:
1. Test onboarding flow end-to-end
2. Check that interests are being extracted correctly
3. Monitor Vercel function logs for any issues
