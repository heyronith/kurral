# Sidebar Feature Concepts: Replacing News & Trending

## Context

**Current Features to Replace:**
- **Trending News Section**: AI-generated personalized news headlines with story clusters
- **Trending Topics**: Topics trending by post volume/engagement (similar to Twitter/X)

**Kurral's Unique Positioning:**
- Real-time AI fact-checking infrastructure (claims extraction, verification)
- Kurral Score: 5-dimension value scoring (factual rigor, insight, practicality, tone, effort)
- Value-based recognition (not view-based)
- Transparency (every post shows why it appeared)
- Natural language feed control

**Target Audience:**
- Truth-seekers who care about accuracy
- Quality creators who want recognition for value, not engagement
- Users tired of black-box algorithms and rage-bait

## Top 3 Feature Concepts

### 1. **Claim Tracker** 
*"See what's being verified right now"*

A real-time feed of factual claims currently being fact-checked across the platform, showing the verification process as it happens. Users see trending claims (e.g., "AI will replace 40% of jobs by 2030") with live status indicators: "Verifying...", "Verified True", "Needs Review", or "False - Blocked". Each claim links to the original post and shows the evidence trail. **Why it's novel:** No other platform exposes the fact-checking process in real-time or surfaces claims before they go viral. This leverages Kurral's unique fact-checking infrastructure that competitors can't easily replicate. It creates engagement around truth-seeking rather than controversy, perfectly aligned with Kurral's "trust what you read" positioning.

### 2. **Value Signals**
*"Posts rising on merit, not momentum"*

A curated feed of posts and creators gaining traction based on Kurral Score dimensions (high insight, strong factual rigor, practical value) rather than raw engagement metrics. Shows posts with rising value scores, creators whose Kurral Score is climbing, and content that's being recognized for quality. Each entry displays which dimension is driving the rise (e.g., "High Insight Score", "Strong Factual Rigor"). **Why it's novel:** Twitter/X and Bluesky show trending based on engagement velocity. TikTok shows viral content. Reddit shows upvotes. None surface content based on multi-dimensional value scoring. This is defensible because it requires Kurral's unique value pipeline infrastructure (5-dimension scoring, fact-checking integration, reputation system) that competitors would need years to replicate. It rewards quality creators and creates aspirational engagement around producing valuable content.

### 3. **Truth Debates**
*"Where fact-checking meets discussion"*

Surfaces active discussions where fact-checks are being challenged, verified, or expanded upon. Shows posts with fact-check status "needs_review" or "mixed" that have active comment threads, posts where users are providing additional evidence, and conversations where the community is collectively refining the truth. Each entry shows the fact-check status, claim being discussed, and engagement quality score. **Why it's novel:** While Reddit has discussions and Twitter has replies, no platform combines real-time fact-checking with discussion surfacing. This creates engagement around collaborative truth-seeking rather than argumentative debates. It's defensible because it requires both the fact-checking infrastructure AND the discussion quality analysis that Kurral already has. This feature turns fact-checking from a passive filter into an active engagement driver, perfectly aligned with Kurral's transparency and value-based recognition.

## Why These Features Are Defensible

1. **Claim Tracker**: Requires real-time fact-checking infrastructure with claims extraction, verification pipeline, and status tracking. Competitors would need to build this from scratch.

2. **Value Signals**: Requires the full Kurral Score system (5-dimension value pipeline, fact-checking integration, reputation tracking, 30-day rolling value stats). This is a multi-year build for competitors.

3. **Truth Debates**: Requires both fact-checking infrastructure AND discussion quality analysis. The combination is unique and hard to replicate.

## Engagement Strategy

All three features create engagement aligned with Kurral's values:
- **Claim Tracker**: Curiosity-driven ("Is this true?") → Click to see verification → Engage with verified content
- **Value Signals**: Aspirational ("How do I create valuable content?") → Follow high-scoring creators → Learn from quality posts
- **Truth Debates**: Collaborative ("Let's figure this out together") → Join discussion → Provide evidence → Build reputation

## Implementation Priority

**Recommended Order:**
1. **Value Signals** (highest impact, leverages existing Kurral Score infrastructure)
2. **Claim Tracker** (high novelty, requires fact-checking status tracking)
3. **Truth Debates** (requires both systems, highest complexity but most unique)
