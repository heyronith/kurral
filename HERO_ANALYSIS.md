## Current Hero

**Title:** "You are the algorithm."

**Subtitle:** "Control your feed. Choose your audience. Trust what you read. Get recognized for value, not views."

---

## App Philosophy Analysis

Based on comprehensive codebase review, Kurral's core philosophy centers on:

### 1. **Algorithm Control** (Primary Differentiator)
- Natural language control: "show more AI posts", "mute politics"
- Every recommendation is explained
- Transparent, predictable algorithms ("dumb" beats black-box "smart")
- User controls ranking signals in real-time

### 2. **Audience Targeting**
- Creators choose who sees their posts
- AI matches content to users whose profiles align
- Target by interests, expertise, location

### 3. **Value-Based Recognition**
- Kurral Score: 5 dimensions (factual rigor, insight, practicality, tone, effort)
- Recognition based on value, not views
- Future monetization based on value system

### 4. **Truth Intelligence**
- Real-time fact-checking before posts go live
- False claims blocked instantly
- Verified content rises

### 5. **Transparency**
- Data ownership (export anytime)
- No data selling to advertisers
- No dark patterns or addiction optimization

From `ValuePropositionSection.tsx`:
- "Stop fighting the feed" (most prominent - appears as primary tagline)
- "Stop shouting into the void"
- "Get recognized for what matters"
- "Trust what you read"
- "Your data, your rules"

From `index.html` meta description:

## Analysis of Current Hero

### Title: "You are the algorithm."

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Catchy and memorable
- ✅ Unique positioning that stands out
- ✅ Directly addresses the core differentiator (algorithm control)
- ✅ Empowering message

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ Slightly abstract - doesn't immediately communicate it's a social media platform
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize the natural language control aspect (the most unique feature)
- ⚠️ "Stop fighting the feed" (from ValuePropositionSection) is more direct and emotional

**Verdict:** Good, but could be more specific about the natural language control feature.

### Subtitle: "Control your feed. Choose your audience. Trust what you read. Get recognized for value, not views."

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Covers all 4 main pillars comprehensively
- ✅ Clear benefit statements
- ✅ "Get recognized for value, not views" is strong and unique

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ **Too long** - 4 clauses is a lot to process at first glance
- ⚠️ **Missing natural language control** - The most unique feature ("talk to your feed in plain English") isn't mentioned
- ⚠️ **"Trust what you read"** is important but may not be the #1 differentiator for initial hook
- ⚠️ Tries to cover everything, which dilutes impact

**Verdict:** Comprehensive but tries to say too much. Should focus on 2-3 core benefits, with natural language control being one of them.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Emphasize Natural Language Control (Recommended)

**Title:** "You are the algorithm."

**Subtitle:** "Talk to your feed in plain English. Control what you see. Get recognized for value, not views."

**Rationale:**
- Natural language control is the most unique and immediately understandable feature
- "Talk to your feed in plain English" is concrete and differentiates from competitors
- Keeps the strong "value, not views" message
- More concise (3 clauses vs 4)

### Option 2: Use "Stop Fighting the Feed" (More Emotional)

**Title:** "Stop fighting the feed."

**Subtitle:** "Control your algorithm with natural language. Get recognized for value, not views."

**Rationale:**
- "Stop fighting the feed" is the most prominent tagline in the codebase
- More emotional and relatable pain point
- Still emphasizes natural language control
- Shorter, punchier

### Option 3: Keep Current but Refine

**Title:** "You are the algorithm."

**Subtitle:** "Control your feed with natural language. Choose your audience. Get recognized for value, not views."

**Rationale:**
- Keeps the catchy title
- Adds "natural language" to emphasize the unique feature
- Removes "Trust what you read" (can be mentioned later)
- Still 3 clauses but more focused

---

## Final Verdict

**Current hero is GOOD but not OPTIMAL.**

**Issues:**
1. Missing emphasis on natural language control (the most unique feature)
2. Subtitle is too long (4 clauses)
3. "Trust what you read" is important but not the primary hook

**Recommended Change:**

**Title:** "You are the algorithm." ✅ (Keep - it's catchy and unique)

**Subtitle:** "Talk to your feed in plain English. Control what you see. Get recognized for value, not views."

**Why this works:**
- Leads with the most unique feature (natural language control)
- More concise (3 clauses)
- Maintains the strong "value, not views" message
- Immediately understandable and differentiated from competitors
- "Talk to your feed in plain English" is concrete and memorable

## Alternative Consideration

If you want to test a more direct approach, consider:

**Title:** "Stop fighting the feed."

**Subtitle:** "Control your algorithm with natural language. Get recognized for value, not views."

This uses the most prominent tagline from your value proposition section and is more immediately relatable to the pain point users experience on other platforms.

## User's Proposed Subtitle Analysis

**Proposed:** "Social media without the manipulation. Control your feed, target your audience, and get paid for quality."

### Strengths:
1. ✅ **"Social media without the manipulation"** - Excellent! Directly addresses the core pain point and aligns perfectly with the transparency/anti-manipulation philosophy found throughout the codebase
2. ✅ **"Control your feed"** - Core feature, already in current subtitle
3. ✅ **"target your audience"** - Core feature (audience tuning), accurately represents the platform
4. ✅ **More concise** - 3 clauses vs current 4 clauses
5. ✅ **Strong opening** - "Social media without the manipulation" is a powerful differentiator

### Potential Issue:
⚠️ **"get paid for quality"** - Accuracy concern:
- Codebase consistently says: **"In the future, monetization will be based on this value system"**
- Current messaging is: **"Get recognized for value, not views"** (not "get paid")
- There IS aspirational messaging in Login.tsx ("Value-based earnings if you're a creator") and Signup.tsx ("Earn from value, not vanity metrics")
- However, the actual monetization system appears to be future-focused

**Recommendation:**
- If monetization is launching soon → This subtitle works great!
- If monetization is still future → Consider: "get recognized for quality" instead of "get paid for quality" to be accurate
- Alternative: "and earn from quality" (softer, aligns with aspirational messaging)

### Comparison:

**Your Proposed:**
"Social media without the manipulation. Control your feed, target your audience, and get paid for quality."

**Slightly Adjusted (if monetization isn't live yet):**
"Social media without the manipulation. Control your feed, target your audience, and get recognized for quality."

**Verdict:** Your proposed subtitle is **STRONG** - it's more direct, emotional, and immediately communicates the value proposition. The "without the manipulation" opening is excellent. The only consideration is the accuracy of "get paid" vs current state.
